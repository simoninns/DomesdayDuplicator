                   CyUSB Suite For Linux, version 1.0.4
                   ====================================

Pre-requisites:
 1. libusb-1.0.x is required for compilation and functioning of the API
    library.
 2. Native gcc/g++ tool-chain and the GNU make utility are required for
    compiling the library and application.
 2. qt4 is required for building the cyusb_linux GUI application.
 3. The pidof command is used by the cyusb_linux application to handle
    hot-plug of USB devices.

Installation Steps:

 1. cd to the main directory where files where extracted and execute 'make'.
    This will compile the libcyusb library and create a static library.

    For example, if the archive is extracted to /home/user/cyusb_linux_1.0.4; then
    e.g.: user@desktop:/home/user/cyusb_linux_1.0.4 $ make

 2. Make sure that the install.sh script is executable by changing the mode
    of install.sh file.
    e.g.: user@desktop:/home/user/cyusb_linux_1.0.4 $ chmod +x install.sh

 3. The install.sh script compiles the cyusb_linux GUI application, and installs
    the libcyusb library and the application in the system directories (/usr/local/).
    It also sets up a set of UDEV rules and updates the environment variables under
    the /etc directory.

    As these changes require root (super user) permissions, the install.sh script
    needs to be executed from a root login.

    e.g.: root@desktop:/home/user/cyusb_linux_1.0.4 $ ./install.sh

 4. The GUI application can now be launched using the 'cyusb_linux' command.
