# Contributing to Domesday Duplicator

Thank you for your interest in improving Domesday Duplicator. Please follow the guidelines below to help us review and merge changes smoothly.

## Project Contributions (Firmware/Hardware/Tools)
- Discuss significant changes via an issue first when possible so we can align on approach and scope.
- Keep changes focused: smaller, self-contained pull requests are easier to review.
- Include clear descriptions of what changed and why; mention related issues or discussions.
- Add or update tests when applicable, and describe how you verified the change (e.g., build, simulation, or manual testing steps).
- Follow existing coding style in the area you touch and avoid unnecessary whitespace-only changes.

## Documentation Contributions
- The project documentation now lives in the dedicated docs repository: https://github.com/simoninns/DomesdayDuplicator-docs
- Use that repository for any documentation issues or pull requests. Keep PRs concise and include screenshots or before/after comparisons when UI or visual changes are involved.
- If you spot documentation gaps while working here, feel free to open an issue in the docs repo with context and links to relevant code or hardware changes.
